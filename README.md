### What I learned

The use of templates and the dynamic generation of information, the updating of the dom, the use of local data.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
const template = 
  `<div class='activity-container activity-container--${nameClass}'> 
      <div class='activity'>
        <div class='activity__category'>
          <p>${title}</p>
          <p>...</p>
        </div>
      <div class='activity__duration'>
        <p class='hour'>${hour}hrs</p>
        <p class='day'>Last Week - ${prev}hr</p>
      </div>
    </div>
</div>`

```
